"""policy_hybrid.py — owl-style prompt templates for hybrid GUI + MCP agent.

Uses the NousFnCall protocol that Qwen was trained on: tools are serialized into
the system message by qwen_agent.NousFnCallPrompt, and the model responds with
  <thinking>...</thinking>
  <tool_call>{"name": ..., "arguments": {...}}</tool_call>
  <conclusion>...</conclusion>

This module only owns the text templates. Message assembly (NousFnCallPrompt +
screenshots) lives in OSWorld-main/mm_agents/hybrid_agent_local.py.
